Modeling confirmation bias by having a "multiplier" for confirming events
Testing to see if having some kind of bias toward confirming evidence helps an agent converge to the ground truth faster in a short term period

To do:
decide on different configurations, i.e. which biases to check, how many trials, etc. for experiment

get experiment to save np file of distribution over time for graphing (look at qgpt for that)

Graph results (consider jupyter notebook for inline matplotlib)
what needs to be graphed?
