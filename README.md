Modeling confirmation bias by having a "multiplier" for confirming events
Testing to see if having some kind of bias toward confirming evidence helps an agent converge to the ground truth faster in a short term period

To do:
Design experiment
    decide on different configurations, i.e. which biases to check, how many trials, etc.
Graph results (consider jupyter notebook for inline matplotlib)
