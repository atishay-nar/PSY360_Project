Modeling confirmation bias by having a "multiplier" for confirming events
Testing to see if having some kind of bias toward confirming evidence helps an agent converge to the ground truth faster in a short term period

To do:
Decide on different configurations, i.e. which biases to check, how many trials, etc. for experiment

Decide which configuration are required forpaper 

Consider linear drift as opposed to random walk

Graph multiple simulations side by side
Any other metrics besides MSE? Maybe convergence time within a threshold
